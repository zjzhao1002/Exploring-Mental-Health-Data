# Exploring-Mental-Health-Data
The goal is to use data from a mental health survey to explore factors that may cause individuals to experience depression. 
This is project for the [Exploring Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11) competition at Kaggle.

Three models: **XGBoost**, **LightGBM** and **CatBoost** have been used and fine tuned. Finally, I perform an ensemble of these models.
